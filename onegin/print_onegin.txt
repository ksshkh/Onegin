And I couldn't think of a better one.
But, my God, what a bore
Half - dead to amuse,
He forced himself to respect himself
He has pillows to fix,
His example to others is science;
It's sad to bring medicine,
My uncle has the most honest rules,
Sigh and think about yourself:
Sit with the patient day and night,
What low cunning
When seriously ill,
When the devil will take you!
Without taking a step away!
